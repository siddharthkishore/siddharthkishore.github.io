I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University.

My research interests are in development, health and agricultural economics.

The first two chapters of my dissertation explores the impacts of weather fluctuations on child health and, disability rates with a focus on monsoon rainfall in rural India.  Specifically, I focus on the effect of rainfall shocks on child health and explore how soil organic carbon content (a measure of soil health) moderates the negative health effects of shocks. Then, I test for the existence of a medium-term effect of early-life exposure to rainfall shocks on the disability rates in India. In the third chapter, I examine whether providing work opportunities to women impact their use of family planning methods. My findings contribute to the literature related to climate change and development economics.	

I look forward to connecting with you. Please contact me at siddharth.kishore@colostate.edu
