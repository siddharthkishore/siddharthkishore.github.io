**Public Sector Job Guarantees and Family Planning Choices in Rural India** (with Dale T. Manning)

To show how providing work opportunities affects women’s’ use of family planning methods, we exploit the staggered timing of an employment guarantee scheme in rural India. Using survey data from rural India, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy and inverse probability of treatment weighting techniques to estimate causal effects. Results suggest an increase of 2 percentage points (a 3% increase) in the use of modern methods of family planning among married women with the introduction of an employment guarantee scheme. Analysis of heterogeneous impacts suggest that our main results are driven by areas with higher proportions of agricultural labor prior to the program and by women aged 35 and older. Moreover, the workfare program has increased the uptake of contraceptives in low-income households. These results provide empirical evidence that targeting labor market opportunities towards women can affect family planning choices, with important implications for economic development outcomes.

**Early-life exposure to drought on later-life disability**

This paper causally estimates the impact of early-life exposure to drought on disability rates in later-life in a developing country context. We exploit the geographic and cohort variation in exposure on the prevalence of disability in later-life. We show that this early-life exposure significantly increased the prevalence of locomotor disability in adulthood. The impact is larger for males and members of rural households. The nutritional status of rural households is weather dependent and is a likely mechanism of impact. A better understanding of the onset of disability of an individual opens a wide window for policy intervention.
