## Rainfall shocks, soil health, and child health outcomes

This paper explores the impact of monsoon rainfall shocks on child health outcomes in rural India at varying levels of soil organic carbon. I combine high resolution spatial data on soil organic carbon content and weather with the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for India (2015-2016) to estimate the linkage between monsoon rainfall shock, soil health, and child health. Weather variables and soil determine crop productivity and thus affect human health through food access in low and middle income countries. I contribute to the literature by demonstrating direct and indirect impact of soil health on childhood outcome of wasting. Using a coarsened exact matching method, I estimate that having high soil health can result a 26 percent improvement in child wasting. I also demonstrate that having high soil health can moderate adverse impacts from weather shocks.

## Workfare programs and family planning: The case of MGNREGA

To show how providing work opportunities to women affects their use of family planning methods, I exploit the variation in implementation timing of the employment guarantee scheme in rural India. I employ  difference-in-differences and inverse probability of treatment weighting techniques to estimate the causal effects. The results suggest an increase of 2 percentage points in the use of any method of family planning among currently married women with the introduction of the employment guarantee scheme. Specifically, the use of modern contraceptive methods has increased with significant heterogeneity across poor and non-poor households. I do not find heterogeneity in the use of family planning methods by the performance of states of workfare programs. My findings help inform our understanding of the women's labor market, contraceptive use, and fertility.

## Early-life exposure to drought on later-life disability

This paper causally estimates the impact of early-life exposure to drought on disability rates in later-life in a developing country context. We exploit the geographic and cohort variation in exposure on the prevalence of disability in later-life. We show that this early-life exposure significantly increased the prevalence of locomotor disability in adulthood. The impact is larger for males and members of rural households. The nutritional status of rural households is weather dependent and is a likely mechanism of impact. A better understanding of the onset of disability of an individual opens a wide window for policy intervention.
