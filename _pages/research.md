## Rainfall shocks, soil health and child health outcomes in rural India

Using Demographic and Health Survey round fourth for India in 2015-16, I investigate the heterogeneous impact of rainfall shocks by variations in soil health for child health outcomes in rural India.

## 

Using a nationally representative data this paper studies the labor impacts of rainfall variability in rural India from 2004 to 2011. We explore a non-linear relationship between weather variables and labor demographics using a novel data set that integrates spatial distribution of agro-climatic variables within a district with the national employment and unemployment situations. We provide a critical examination of the relationship between rainfall variability and employment. The result suggests that the labor in rural India reallocates to non-agricultural sectors, particularly the construction sector for its relatively low switching cost. The findings of this paper contribute to the climate and development literature.

## Early-life exposure to rainfall shocks and adult socio-economic status

Using India Human Development Survey pane dataset, I investigate the early-life exposure to the rainfall shocks and adult socio-economic status.
