## Rainfall shocks, soil health, and child health outcomes

This paper explores the impact of monsoon rainfall shocks on child health outcomes in rural India at varying levels of soil organic carbon. I combine high resolution spatial data on soil organic carbon content and weather with the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for India (2015-2016) to estimate the linkage between monsoon rainfall shock, soil health, and child health. Weather variables and soil determine crop productivity and thus affect human health through food access in low and middle income countries. I contribute to the literature by demonstrating direct and indirect impact of soil health on childhood outcome of wasting. Using a coarsened exact matching method, I estimate that having high soil health can result in 26 percent improvement in child wasting. I also demonstrate that having high soil health can moderate adverse impacts from weather shocks.

## Workfare programs and reproductive choice: The case of MGNREGA

Understanding how providing work opportunities to women impact their use of reproductive choice has important implications for population and economic development of a nation. This paper examines the impact of employment guarantee scheme on women reproductive choice using a nationally representative dataset. I employ  difference-in-differences technique with inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate the causal effects. The result suggests an increase of 3 percentage points in family planning methods with the introduction of employment guarantee scheme. Specifically, the use of modern methods of family planning have increased. Intra-household bargaining as well as additional household income is a likely mechanism of impact.

## Early-life exposure to drought on later-life disability

This paper causally estimate the impact of early-life exposure to drought on disability rates in later-life in a developing country context. We exploit the geographic and cohort variation in exposure on the prevalence of disability in later-life. We show that this early-life exposure significantly increased the prevalence of locomotor disability in adulthood. The impact is larger for males and members of rural households. The nutritional status of rural households is weather dependent and is a likely mechanism of impact. A better understanding of the onset of disability of an individual opens a wide window for policy intervention.
