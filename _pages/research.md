## Rainfall shocks, soil health and child health outcomes in rural India

I combine high resolution spatial data on soil organic carbon content and weather with the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for India (2015-2016) to estimate the linkage between monsoon rainfall shock, soil health, and child health. This paper explores the impact of rainfall shocks on child health outcomes in rural India at varying levels of soil organic carbon. Empirical results indicate that monsoon rainfall shocks negatively impact child health outcomes measured through anthropomorphic metrics. Regions with high endowments of soil organic carbon content experience smaller impacts from monsoon rainfall shocks, though the effect is small and sensitive to specification.

## Public workfare programs as agricultural insurance: Evidence from rural India, 2004-2012

The research explores the labor market impacts of monsoon weather fluctuations in rural India for the period between 2004-2011. During this time period, India rolled out a workfare program (National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) that guarantees jobs for rural workers. We exploit this rollout to examine how the existence of the workfare program moderates the impact of non-linear weather variables on wages and employment sectors. This analysis uses a novel data set that integrates the spatial distribution of agro-climatic variables with nationally available employment and unemployment data at the district level (similar to a US county). Preliminary results suggest that labor in rural India reallocates to non-agricultural sectors in response to weather shocks. In district-years that have a workfare program available, wages remain higher, and households are less likely to reallocate labor to private sector non-agricultural work. This suggests that workfare programs may provide an alternative to crop insurance for smoothing incomes. Current work explores the cost effectiveness of workfare programs versus subsidies for crop insurance.

## Early-life exposure to monsoon rainfall shock and the adult socio-economic outcomes: Findings from India

I explore the medium-term effects of early-life exposure to monsoon rainfall shocks on the adult socio-economic status of individuals. Potential mechanisms leading to medium term impacts include impacts to child health, educational attainment, and employment choices in India. This paper combines India Human Development Survey (IHDS) panel data with historical rainfall data to map early-life monsoon rainfall shocks to adults from the survey. Preliminary results suggest that early-life exposure to monsoon rainfall shocks affects the probability of having a wage or salaried job later in life. Current work explores the educational attainment mechanism and build on results from chapter 1 that find that child health is impacted by monsoon rainfall shocks.
