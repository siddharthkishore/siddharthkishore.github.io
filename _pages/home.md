Welcome to my website!

I am a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. 

My dissertation explores the impacts of weather fluctuations on child health and, adult employment with a focus on monsoon rainfall in rural India. Specifically, I focus on the effect of rainfall shocks on child health and explore how soil organic carbon content (a measure of soil health) moderates the negative health effects of shocks. Then, I examine if a public welfare program can substitute for agricultural insurance in rural India where insurance markets are underdeveloped. In the third chapter, I test for the existence of a medium-term effect of early-life exposure to rainfall shocks on the adult employment status in India. My findings contribute to the literature related to climate change and development economics.
