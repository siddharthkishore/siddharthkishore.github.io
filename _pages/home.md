Welcome to my website!

I am a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. 

My research interests are in applied demographic and labor economics related to child health and household well-being. The empirical analysis in my research relies extensively on the mix of socio-economic and spatial data, and GIS techniques.
