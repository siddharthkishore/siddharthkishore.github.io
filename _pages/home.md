Welcome to my website!

I am a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. 

My current research focuses on soil health, agricultural performances, and household well-being in developing countries. The empirical section relies extensively on secondary data available publicly and GIS techniques.
