Welcome to my website!

I am a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. 

My research interests are in agricultural development and household well-being. My current research focuses on applied demographic and labor economics related to child health. The empirical analysis in my research relies extensively on the mix of socio-economic and spatial data, and GIS techniques.
