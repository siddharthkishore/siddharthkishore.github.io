I am an agricultural economics job market candidate at the Colorado State University, Fort Collins.

My research focus is at the intersection of agribusiness, climate, and health in low- and middle-income countries.

In my job market paper, I investigate whether providing work opportunities to women impacts their use of family planning methods. Using survey data from rural India, I employ a difference-in-differences strategy and inverse probability of treatment weighting techniques to estimate the causal effects. Other two chapters of my dissertation explore the impacts of weather fluctuations on child health and, disability rates with a focus on monsoon rainfall in rural India. Specifically, I focus on the effect of rainfall shocks on child health and explore how soil organic carbon content (a measure of soil health) moderates the negative health effects of shocks. Then, I test for the existence of a medium-term effect of early-life exposure to rainfall shocks on the disability rates in India.

I look forward to connecting with you. Please contact me at siddharth.kishore@colostate.edu
