Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University.

My research interests are in development, health and agricultural economics.

My dissertation explores the impacts of weather fluctuations on child health and, adult employment with a focus on monsoon rainfall in rural India. Specifically, I focus on the effect of rainfall shocks on child health and explore how soil organic carbon content (a measure of soil health) moderates the negative health effects of shocks. Then, I examine if a public welfare program can substitute for agricultural insurance in rural India where insurance markets are underdeveloped. In the third chapter, I test for the existence of a medium-term effect of early-life exposure to rainfall shocks on the adult employment status in India. My findings contribute to the literature related to climate change and development economics.

I look forward to connecting with you. Please contact me at
