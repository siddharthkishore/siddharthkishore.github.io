Welcome!
I am a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University. 

My current research focuses on soil health, agricultural performances, and household well-being in developing countries. Specifically, I investigate the heterogeneous impact of rainfall shocks by variations in soil health for child health outcomes in rural India.
