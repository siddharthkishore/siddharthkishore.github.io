I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [School of Public Policy](https://spp.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside. At UC Riverside, I am advised by [Ariel Dinar](https://waterdialogue.ucr.edu/ariel-dinar-climate-change) and [Mehdi Nemati](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/mehdin) as part of the impact of climate change on California's agricultural research [lab](https://waterdialogue.ucr.edu/).

I received my Ph.D. in agricultural and resource economics from [Colorado State University](https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/) in May 2023, supervised by [Dale Manning](https://agsci.colostate.edu/old-dare/people/faculty/dale-manning/).

I study empirical microeconomics, with particular focus on climate shocks and the impact of adaptation policies on agriculture and human health. I am currently studying land-use and climate change in the U.S.
