I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [Valley Institute for Sustainability, Technology, and Agriculture](https://vista.ucmerced.edu/) at the University of California Merced. I am part of the research team at the [Water Systems Management Lab](https://wsm.ucmerced.edu/), led by Prof. Josué Medellín-Azuara, and working on California's Fifth Climate Change Assessment Report.  

Before this, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the [School of Public Policy](https://waterdialogue.ucr.edu/ariel-dinar-climate-change) at University of California Riverside and worked under the supervision of Drs. Ariel Dinar and Mehdi Nemati.

I received my Ph.D. in agricultural and resource economics from [Colorado State University](https://agsci.colostate.edu/dare/) in May 2023.
