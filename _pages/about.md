I am an agricultural economics job market candidate at the Colorado State University, Fort Collins.

My research focus is at the intersection of agribusiness, climate, and health in low- and middle-income countries.

The first two chapters of my dissertation explores the impacts of weather fluctuations on child health and, disability rates with a focus on monsoon rainfall in rural India.  Specifically, I focus on the effect of rainfall shocks on child health and explore how soil organic carbon content (a measure of soil health) moderates the negative health effects of shocks. Then, I test for the existence of a medium-term effect of early-life exposure to rainfall shocks on the disability rates in India. In the third chapter, I examine whether providing work opportunities to women impact their use of family planning methods. My findings contribute to the literature related to climate change and development economics.	

I look forward to connecting with you. Please contact me at siddharth.kishore@colostate.edu
